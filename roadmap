play queue management
the playurl lives for 2 hours
in media list page:
    click once, add all following into queue
    what if the cnd outdates?
    only add bvid into queue.
    when playing it, get cdn url
    the player does not support it!
    The list must be a state!
    自己维护一个列表：
_player.streams.position.listen((position) {
      if (_player.streams.duration.value != null &&
          position >= _player.streams.duration.value!) {
        _playNext();
      }
    });
